<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>

<!-- I learned about HTML grandparent/parent/child/ sibling relationships and how
each is nested inside the other, ie: a div tag nested inside a body tag would make
the div tag the child of the body tag. Then the paragraph tag that is nested inside
of the div tag would be a grandchild to the body tag and a child to the div tag. -->
