/* Objects can be assigned to variables and we can create an object literal using
the curly braces. Ojects are filled with unordered data and organized into
key-value pairs. A key is similar to a variable name that points to a location
in the memory which holds the value. A value can be anything from a string to
an integer, a function and even another object */
