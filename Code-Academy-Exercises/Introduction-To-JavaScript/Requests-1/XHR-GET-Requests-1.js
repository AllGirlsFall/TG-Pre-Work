/* After pages load, asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) are what
enable requests to be made. The XMLHttprequest API can be used to make
different kinds of requests and suport other forms of data. You must create
a new object for the XMLHttprequest, specify the URL and response type and
then declare a function. You then open a request and send the object. */
