/* Data types are classifications of different kinds of data used in programming.
There are seven different types of data in JavaScript: integers, strings, boolean,
null, undefined, symbols and object. Integers, strings, boolean, null, undefined
and symbols are all primitive data types and the most basic types in JavaScript.
In the above example both strings and integers have been logged to the console.
Integers can be either whole numbers or decimals and strings can be single words
or entire sentences. Strings are always placed inside quotation marks (single or
double). */
