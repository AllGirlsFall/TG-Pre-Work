/* Each time you write new code in Javascript the browser saves it
an instance of that data type. Every string instance has a property
called length which enables you to see the length of the string or
amount of characters. You can get this information by appending the
string with a period (which is another operator) and the name of the property.
By appending the string in the example above we can see how many characters are
in the entire string (27). */
