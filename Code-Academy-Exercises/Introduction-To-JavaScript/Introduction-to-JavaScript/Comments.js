yourself and other developers. You can also try out code and comment it out instead
of deleting it since the computer does not read the comments. There are two types
commenting in Javascript: single comments denoted with two forward slashes (//)
and multi-line comments which use a forward slash and asterick to open and close
the comment section. */
