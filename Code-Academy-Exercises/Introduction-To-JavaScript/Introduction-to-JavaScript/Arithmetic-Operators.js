/* Javascript has arithmatic operators that enable us to do math when
coding. An operator is a character that performs a task on the code. The
math operators in Javascript are: add, subtract, multiply, divide and
remainder. The first four operators behave just as they would when performing
a mathematical calculation and the remainder operator takes two numbers and
divides one by the other as many times as evenly possible and returns whatever
is left over. */
