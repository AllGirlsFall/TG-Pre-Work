/* Javascript has other built in objects that assist with functionality in coding.
Objects have methods which allow the developer to perform actions by
appending the object with the dot operator, then the method name and then
calling the method with parenthesis. In the example above the Math operator is
used to log a random number between 0 and 100, then turn that number into a whole
number greater than or equal to that random number by using the .ceil method.
.isInteger checks if the parameter (2017) is an integer or not. */
