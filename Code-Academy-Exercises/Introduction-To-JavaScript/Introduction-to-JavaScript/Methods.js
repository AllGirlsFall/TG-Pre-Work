// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());

/* Methods are actions that are perfomed in Javascript and there are many built-in
methods in Javascript. Much like .log() in console.log() we append these
methods to an instance using the period operator, then the method name and then
call that method with the parenthesis. */
