/* Variables are containers for values and can be thought of as information that
lives in the computer's memory; they are not, however, values. A variety of
information such as username, account, personalized greetings can be stored in
variables. Variables label and store data for later use. They can give data a
descriptive name in order for code to make more sense to readers and you can also
update the information stored in variables. You can get or reference information
that is stored in a variable. */
