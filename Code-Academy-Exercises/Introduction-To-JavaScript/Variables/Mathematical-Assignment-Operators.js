/* Variables and math operators can be used to calculate new values and
store them in variables. In the first example above, the assignment operator
combined with a mathematical operator takes the value of levelUp and adds 5 to
it in order to give a new value to the levelUp variable.
Addition, subtraction,multiplication and division can all be used. */
