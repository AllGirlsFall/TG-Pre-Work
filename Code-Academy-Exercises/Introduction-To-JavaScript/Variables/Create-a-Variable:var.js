/* Prior to the ES6 (ecmascript) version that was updated in 2015, developers
could only declare variables with the var keyword. 'Var' is short for variable
and it's the first thing written when declaring a variable followed by the name
of the variable and then the assignment operator (which is an = sign) and then
the value of the variable. Once a varialbe is declared you can print it to the
console using the name of the variable as the parameter in console.log(). */
