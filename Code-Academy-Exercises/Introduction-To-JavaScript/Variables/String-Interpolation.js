/* In Javascript version ES6 we can interpolated (insert) variables
into strings using template literals. Template literals are string literals
that allow embedded expressions. They are wrapped in backticks and have a
placeholder which has a $ identifier sign and curly brackets and which contains
the name of the variable that's being referenced. Using template literals makes
it easier to see what the output of the code will look like. */
