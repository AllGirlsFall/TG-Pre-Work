/* The updated version has given us two keywords to create variables, one of them
being 'let' which is used in place of 'var'. The let keyword signifies that the
variable can be reassigned a different value. The syntax is the same for declaring
a variable with 'var' but with the 'let' keyword in its place. Also mentioned is
the fact that variables can be declared without a value. When this is done a value of
'undefined' will be the output if logged to the console. */
