/* The above code represents some new features that came out with ES6 that throw
errors when used in an older browser due to compatibility issues. There is a
period before a software update is released where there is unsupported language
syntax as well as security vulnerabilities. There are a few tools that developers
can use when adddressing compatibility issues: caniuse.com is a website that
provides information on web browser compatibility and HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Babel is a JavaScript library that converts new, unsupported JavaScript into an
older version of JavaScript (ES6 to ES5). */
