/* npm install command installs new Node packages locally.  It also installs all
of the dependencies for the given package. The babel-cli package has command line
babel tools and the babel-preset-env has the code that maps ES6 to ES5. The
-D flag instructs the npm to add a property called devDependencies which makes it
so other developers can run your project without installing each package separately. */
