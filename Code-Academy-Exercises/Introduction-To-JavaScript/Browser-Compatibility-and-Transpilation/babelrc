/* Once the Babel packages have been downloaded the version of the source
Javascript code needs to be specified. This can be done inside a file that is
created with the touch keyword in the root directory (touch .babelrc). Inside the
babelrc file is where you define the preset for your source JavaScript file. The
code in the example above needs to be run to instruct Babel to transpile code
from ES6+ and later. */
