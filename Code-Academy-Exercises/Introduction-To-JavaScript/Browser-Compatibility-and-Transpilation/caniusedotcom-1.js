/* Most new browsers support most of the ES6 library but there are a couple of
sources of compatibility issues: some users haven't updated their browsers and a
few features like modules are not yet supported by most web browsers. The website
caniuse.com lets us look up which browsers support different versions of
JavaScript as well as which specific features are supported and when they gained
support for that feature. */
