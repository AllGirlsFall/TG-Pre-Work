/* npm (node package manager) is used to access and manage
node packages. These are directories that contain JavaScript code
written by other developers and they can be used to reduce duplicated
work as well as avoid bugs. npm init need to be run in the command line
prior to adding the project to Babel. It creates a package.json file in
the root directory which has info about the current JavaScript project. */
