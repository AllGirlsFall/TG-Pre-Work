var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

/* The above lines of code are a few examples of ES5. Prior to ES6,
all variables were declared using the var keyword and string interpolation looked
like a hot mess (in my opinion) and was tedious to write. Some of the reasons
that ES5 was updated to ES6 were: easier to read code, a similarity to other
object oriented languages which made it easier for experienced developers to
transistion to writing JavaScript and getting rid of bugs that were common in ES5.
Ecma also made the new syntax backwards compatible which means ES6 can be mapped
to ES5 code. */
