/* Higher-order functions are functions that accepts functions as parameters, returns
a function or both. When a function is passed into an argument it is not invoked
with the parenthesis as it would evaluate to the return value of that function.
These functions that are passed as arguments are called callback functions. Higher
order functions can be used with any callback function and anonymous functions
can also be callback functions. */
