/* One way to create a function is by using a function declaration. A function
declaration is a function that's tied to a function name. These functions can
be called before they are defined by a process called hoisting. Both function and
variable declarations are put into memory during the compile phase and so
appear to be at the top of the code, however, are actually in the spot where
they are coded. This gives us acess to them before they are declared. */
