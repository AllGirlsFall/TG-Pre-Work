/* A condensed version of arrow syntax functions are called concise body arrow
functions. They remove the need for parenthesis if there is only one parameter
(parenthesis are kept if there are multiple parementers or no parameters )
and remove the curly braces that surround the block of code if the code block
is one line only. The return keyword is also removed and this is known as 'implicit
return'. */
