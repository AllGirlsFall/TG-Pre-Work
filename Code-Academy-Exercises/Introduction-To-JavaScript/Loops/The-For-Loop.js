/* Instead of manually writing out code over and over, we can instruct the
computer to repeat a block of code by writing a loop. A for loop has an iterator
variable that appears in all three expression (i.e. counter). The for loop has several
expressions separated by a comma within a parenthesis.  It is first initialized
by stating where the loop is to start (i.e. let counter = 5), then there's a
stopping condition (loop will run as long as the counter is less than 11 in the
example above) and then the iteration statement which is counter++ in the example
above. This says the value of counter will increase by 1 each time the loop runs.
The code block (in this case, console.log(counter)will run until the expression
evaluates to false. */
