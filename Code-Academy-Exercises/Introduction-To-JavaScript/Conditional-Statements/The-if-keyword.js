/* 'If' is a keyword that tells the program to check a specific condition and
perform a task based on that condition. An if statement is composed of the
keyword first followed by parenthesis which will hold the condition, followed
by curly brackets which contain the block of code (or instructions) that are to
execute depending on how the condition evaluates. If true, the code will run and
if false code won't run. */
