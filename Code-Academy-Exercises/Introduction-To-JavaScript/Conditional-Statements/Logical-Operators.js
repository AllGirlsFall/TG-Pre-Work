/* Operators that work with boolean logic (true and false), which are often used
in conditional statements are called logical operators. There are three logical
operators : the 'and' operator (&&), the 'or' operator (||) and the bang operator
which is also known as the 'not' operator (!). These logical operators can add
more refined and complex conditions to your conditional statement. */
