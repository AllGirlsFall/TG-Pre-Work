/*Output from code above is 'not bed time yet', however, if the logical operator
is changed to the or operator then the output would be 'time to sleep!' as at
least one of the conditions has been met. 



/* Operators that work with boolean logic (true and false), which are often used
in conditional statements, are called logical operators. There are three logical
operators: the 'and' operator (&&), the 'or' operator (||) and the bang operator
which is also known as the 'not' operator (!). These logical operators can add
more refined and complex conditions to your conditional statement. */
