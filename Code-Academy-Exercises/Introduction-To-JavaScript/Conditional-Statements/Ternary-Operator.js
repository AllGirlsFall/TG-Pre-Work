  /* The ternary operator can be used when you want to simplify an if else
  statement. The condition is provided before the question mark and the expression
  that should execute if the statement is true follows that. Instead of
  the 'else' a colon separates the first expression from the second expression
  to be executed in case the condition is false. */
