/* The implicit grid is a built-in algorithm with specifications for the CSS
grid. It determines the placement of elements when there are more elements that
fit into the grid. The implicit grid's default behavior is that items fill up
rows first and add more rows if necessary and these new rows have a height that
supports the content and nothing more.  No exercise for this lesson. */
