/* Hue, saturation and lightness is another way to adjust the color of HTML elements
with CSS. Just like the RGB decimal system, HSL has three different values:  the
first number represents the degree of hue and references a degree (ranging
from 0 -360 degrees) on a color wheel. The second number is saturation and is set
with a percentage which shows how intense/rich a color is. The third number (also a
percentage) is for lightness which sets how light or dark the color is. */
