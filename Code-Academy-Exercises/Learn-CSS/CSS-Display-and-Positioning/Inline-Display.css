/* Each HTML element has a default display value which says if it can share horizontal
space with another element. One such value is 'inline' display. If an element is
displayed inline it means that other elements can be displayed on the same line as
that element. It has a tightly wrapped box around its content and
only takes up the space it needs to display its content. Inline elements can't be
altered in size with height or width properties in CSS. By using the display property
you can make any display any element inline, even elements that do not have that
default like paragraphs and divs. */
