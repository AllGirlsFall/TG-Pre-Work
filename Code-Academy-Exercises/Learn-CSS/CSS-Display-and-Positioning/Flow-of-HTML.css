/* Browsers render html that doesn't have css from top to bottom and left to right
and this is called the flow of elements in HTML. CSS has properties that change
how a browser positions elements and specify where an element is located on the
page. The five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements are: position,
display, z-index, float and clear. These properties can be used in conjuction with
other styling properties. */
