/* Another way to link to non-user fonts that does not require a link tag
in the HTML document is to load fonts using @font-face property. Instead of using
the link in the head section you can use it in the browser. The browser loads the C
CSS rules and you copy the latin rules. You then paste those rules at the top of
the CSS page. */
