/* This lesson explains the difference between vertical and horizontal margin areas
and how they behave. Horizontal margins (left and right) are always displayed
and are added together when you have two elements that are side by side and have
margins. If two divs are next to each other they will be as far apart as the sum
of their adjacent margins. The vertical margins (top and bottom) collapse meaning
that whichever element has the larger margin, it will be that value that will
set the distance. Only margins behave this way; padding is always visible. */
