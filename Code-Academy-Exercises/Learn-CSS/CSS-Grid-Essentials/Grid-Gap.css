/* In order to add space between columns are rows there are a few properties that
can be used. Grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap can individually define space
between columns or rows. The grid-gap property can define each at the same time,
however, the shorthand for this property is not separated by a forward slash. The
grid-gap properties only add space between columns and rows and not at the end
of them. */
