/* This lesson was an introduction to css visual rules. By comparing the code
to the webpage, it seems that the hierarchy of the css structure closely follows
what is in the html document. The body styling is first on the page followed by
h1,h2,h3 and so on. It also seems that elements with tag names are first and followed
by class attributes. */
